		<center><h1>Liars Cheaters and Dirty Dirty Dopers</h1>By Jace, The Mind Sculptor</center>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Cheating is as old as civilization. People have been cheating, lying and stealing to increase their status for as long as people have been living. More recently however, video games have become a new forum where cheating has become extremely prevalent. The internet even allows people to cheat with an anonymity that bypasses many of the previous consequences involved with cheating such as embarrassment, a decrease in social status, or doled out punishments. In this paper, I will be exploring the ideas involve with cheating starting with what it means to cheat in a video game. For this section I will pull on the work done by Mia Consalvo in her book, Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Video Games as there are many ways to define cheating and I will be using some definitions that she puts forth. I will then discuss the reasons that some people cheat along with the differences between single and multiplayer cheating. Finally, I will move into the world of Esports, competitive high stakes gaming, where the allure of cheating becomes much higher. Here I will discuss a problem that has plagued traditional sports for decades but has not been given much light in the world of Esports, doping. I will explain how taking certain drugs can give one player an unfair advantage over another, and I will discuss why this is an issue that should be addressed immediately.
