    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMario has become one of the most iconic video game characters ever. Mario and his brother Luigi have captured the imaginations and entered the homes of millions of families world-wide. However, the games that they are displayed in has perpetuated the idea that women are helpless beings that need to be protected and saved because they can not take care of themselves. The popular brothers have also done a great deal to bring these ideas over to the world of video games. The damsel in distress has become a popular figure in many popular games over the last twenty years.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWomen in video games do have another role that they often fill aside from the helpless damsel in distress. There are many women characters that are given the primary role in a video game, but they are usually only given this role if the developers are attempting to attract users by sexualizing the main character.</p>

  	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll of the women presented in the above video are primary characters in their respective games. Notice that every one of them, with the exception of Clementine, is wearing tight, form fitting, and often revealing clothing. The announcer even mentions the fact that some of the characters are “sexy” and declares that as a reason that they are on the list. A vast majority of women in video games are displayed as either helpless or sexualized, and this portrayal can severely harm the self image of young girls playing the games.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFemales are often represented as weak and defenseless in video games. One of the most popular plot lines is the female character that needs to be saved by the heroic male. In a study done by Melina Burgess, Steven Stermer, and Stephen Burgess in 2007 where they evaluate the content and covers of two hundred twenty-five of the most popular video games according to Amazon’s best seller list, they found that 21% of games that contain a female character portray her as needing the aid of a male in some way<sup>1</sup>. The Mario example mentioned above is a perfect representation of this dynamic. Mario, the main character in the Super Mario Brothers series, spends almost all of his many games attempting to rescue Princess Peach from the evil Bowser. Peach is portrayed as unable to defend herself, and she must be saved by Mario or she will never be able to escape from Bowser. Peach perfectly fits the stereotype of a female character that requires the aid of a male character. Her only function in the game is as a prize for the successful hero. This portrayal of women in video games as defenseless without the help of a man engrains the idea that women can not take care of themselves without the help of a strong male defender in the minds of impressionable adolescent girls.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEven when females are given a main role in the game, they are often portrayed as still needing the help of a man. In the study mentioned above, when a female character was given a primary role in the game, only 10% of the games evaluated, she was almost four times as likely to share the primary role with a male character than a male character was to share the primary role with a female character<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, while twenty of the games that they examined had multiple primary male characters, only one game, “Outlaw Beach Volleyball,” contained multiple primary female characters. Even in this one game, the female characters are very obviously highly sexualized as can be seen from their scantily clad images on the cover<sup>3</sup>. The idea that a female can not take a primary role without the help of a male can be incredibly damaging to any female players wishing to go into leadership positions. These players could easily be swayed into believing that they can not lead without the help of a man by their side.</p>

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFurthermore, video game reviews have become a massive part of the multibillion dollar video game industry. Video games are a serious investment in both time and money. A play through can take as much as fifty hours and a single game can cost upwards of sixty dollars. As such, people need a way to decide if they will enjoy a certain game before they go about buying it. Video game reviews have become a popular method for making this decision. In “Still a Man’s Game: Gender Representation in Online Reviews of Video Games,” James D. Ivory takes a critical look at the differences between how men and women are portrayed in these reviews. He finds that male characters are twelve times more likely to be displayed on a box cover than female characters. Male characters were also far more likely to strike a dominant pose<sup>4</sup>. He found that the percentage of female characters that were described as active in the reviews was far lower than the percentage of male characters, and he found that the percentage of female characters that were distinctly described as passive was far higher. In addition, less than eleven percent of reviewers described a female character as the “lead.” This statistic is in comparison to the seventy-six percent that described a male character as the “lead” character in the reviewed game. The difference in portrayal and role assigned to male and female characters in game reviews perpetuates the idea that females can not be trusted with the difficult procedures often depicted in video games. Young girls reading these reviews will be of the opinion that their place is in support of a powerful male figure, and young boys reading these reviews will be of the opinion that the females in their life should take a backseat and supporting role.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPowerful and independent female characters are not completely absent from the world of video games however. In fact, while a majority of the primary characters in game are male, one can easily name a multitude of games with powerful female leads.  Any of the characters mentioned in the “Top Ten Female Protagonists” video shown above is a perfect example of a powerful female primary character. However, as previously mentioned, every one of these characters except the eleven year old girl, Clementine, is seen wearing tight, revealing clothing. Even Samus, a very popular example of a female lead that is portrayed as gender neutral for a vast majority of the game, is wearing very revealing clothing and given a highly provocative form when she does remove her armor. Females are not only underrepresented in video games, but when they are represented, the vast majority of female characters are sexualized.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLara Croft could be the most blatant example of an overly sexualized female character in a video game ever. Lara Croft is a powerful, talented women that has become the face of a very successful video game franchise. Yet, Lara’s entire character is defined by her “barbie like proportions” instead of her action hero talents<sup>5</sup>. The most popular Tomb Raider patch is a nude raider patch, which shows Lara’s body in the only way that it could possibly be even more sexualized than it is already. A simple google image search of the Nude Raider patch yields 1,072,226 result<sup>5</sup>. Lara certainly does not fit the stereotypical bimbo stereotype, but many female gamers do not even enjoy playing her games because they find her massive breasts and stick thin limbs unrealistic for an action hero and a constant reminder that these games were not made for them. Lara Croft and virtual women like her permit boys and men to develop unrealistic ideals of the female body type. She makes young girls question their self image because they know that they can never have the same proportions that she does, and she acts as a constant reminder to female gamers everywhere that these games were not made for them<sup>6</sup>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJames Ivory also took a critical look at the difference between how male and female characters sexual appeal is represented in video games. It should not be surprising by this point that female characters were significantly underrepresented in the reviews, but it is also worth noting that “when female characters are included in games, it is frequently as nonessential, passive characters, and female characters are often depicted wearing revealing and provocative clothing, and indulging in sexually suggestive behavior”<sup>7</sup>. This implies that the female characters are judged more on their sexual appeal than the importance that they play in the games. In fact, a female character’s attractiveness came up twelve times as often in character reviews than male character’s attractiveness. Furthermore, of the reviews “with pictured female characters, 41% contained sexually suggestive imagery of females; only 4% of the reviews with pictured males similarly included sexually suggestive male representations”<sup>8</sup>.  This prioritizing of what to look for in a female character both affirms the societal pressure that men should look at a women’s attractiveness beyond all else and teaches adolescent girls that it does not matter what they accomplish if they are not attractive.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMoreover, the covers of video games are the first thing that people see when they buy a game. Many people even judge games entirely by the cover when they do not have any experience with the game and do not have access to a trusted review. In Burgess, Burgess, and Stermer’s study on video game covers mentioned previously, they classified male and female characters on the video game covers as normal, busty, or super busty for women and normal, muscular, or super muscular for men in an attempt to determine how often the sexual appeal of characters plays a factor in the character design. They found that female characters were twice as likely to be busty or super busty than male characters were to be muscular or super muscular<sup>3</sup>.  Given the irrelevance of breast size from an action hero oriented perspective, it is hard to interpret these numbers as anything other than sexual objectification. Female characters displayed on the cover of games were also sixty times more likely to be classified as “eye candy” by the study. “Eye candy” was a classification that the researchers gave to characters with no relevant purpose in the game other than to sexually attract the players<sup>3</sup>. The fact that female characters fill this role so much more frequently than male characters just reinforces the idea that the sexual appeal of female characters is often thought of beyond anything else. Both the physical build and game role of female characters displayed on the covers of video games support the idea that female characters main function in gameplay is as a sexual object. Whenever a female character is chosen over a male character as the lead in a game, the purpose is to sexually attract users to the game. As such, young and impressionable players will be of the opinion that a female’s usefulness is in her sexual appeal, which could have devastating effects on the self image of young female players.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a great deal of research that media, especially video game play, can have a serious affect on the minds of young players. Video games are interactive and immersive forms of media. Many players will even think of themselves as the character displayed on the screen. The phrases “I died” and “I shot him” are common in the households of many gamers. In his article, Ivory reports, “a negative relationship between video game play and self-perception questionnaire scores among adolescent girls”<sup>9</sup>. These girls no doubt find themselves influenced by the stories that these games are telling. These girls are being told that they have two choices in life: they can take a secondary role and support a strong man in his endeavors, or they can become as attractive as possible because people will rate them on their sexual appeal throughout their lives. When looked at from this perspective, is it any wonder that twenty-five percent of women surveyed on college campuses have attempted to control their weight through purging<sup>10</sup>. The messages portrayed in video games have a real impact on the lives of the players, and the players most severely affected are the younger, more impressionable players.</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNone of this would be an issue if video games were not so popular. However, according to Burgess, Sterner, and Burgess, “in the last 20 years, video games have become one of the most prevalent forms of entertainment for children and adults”<sup>1</sup>. Eighty-seven percent of children between the ages of eight and seventeen play video games, and eighty percent of girls between these ages play video games. Not only are these girls learning some of the lessons previously mentioned, but the ninety-two percent of boys in this age range that play video games are also learning that women are mainly objects for their sexual amusement. What lessons are we teaching our young men when almost all of them are growing up learning that women are support figures that can sometimes take control if they have incredibly large breasts and are very skinny? Why are people surprised when they see that men take more leadership positions in the working world than women?</p>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVideo games have become one of the most fundamental pieces of American media, but we have to ask ourselves if they are getting across the messages that we want to be given to the young players who find them so enjoyable. Video games currently substantiate the stereotype that women are support figures. They also reinforce the idea that a females main worth is in her sexual appeal, a mentality that has plagued western society for far too long. As always humor says it best, and I will leave you with this clip from College Humor, highlighting one of the fundamental differences between male and female in game attire. Where the males get functional protective armor, the female gets functionally irrelevant provocative armor that does more to show off her body than protect her in combat.</p>
